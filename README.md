# Cycler SQL Database Recorder (Offline)

This code controls the cycler and provides the ability to control both slots, and record data to a local SQL database. The sequence version of the code can be used to customize a charge/discharge profile in the Python code, including wait+status polling segments. It can also be used in "classic" mode with the "single" argument:

python cycler2sql_sequence.py single

python cycler2sql_sequence.py sequence
